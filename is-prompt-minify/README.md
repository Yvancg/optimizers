[![prompt gzip](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yvancg/optimizers/main/metrics/prompt.js.json)](./metrics/prompt.js.json)
[![prompt ops/s](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yvancg/optimizers/main/bench/prompt.json)](./bench/prompt.json)

Compact large language model (LLM) prompts by removing redundancy, normalizing whitespace, and trimming excess formatting ‚Äî without changing meaning.

---

## üöÄ Why

Prompt tokens are expensive.  
Every redundant space, newline, or repeated word wastes compute and cost.  
`is-prompt-minify` provides a lightweight, deterministic way to shrink text before sending it to an AI API.

- Removes duplicated words and blank lines  
- Collapses multi-space sequences  
- Normalizes newlines  
- Reduces token count and improves model throughput 

---

## üåü Features

- ‚úÖ Zero dependencies  
- ‚úÖ O(n) performance  
- ‚úÖ Works in browser, Node, and edge runtimes  
- ‚úÖ Safe for untrusted input (pure string ops)

## üì¶ Usage

```js
import { promptMinify, promptDiff } from './is-prompt-minify/prompt.js';

const text = `
  You are a helpful helpful AI assistant.

  Please please summarize the following following text clearly clearly.
`;

const minified = promptMinify(text);
console.log(minified);
// "You are a helpful AI assistant.\n\nPlease summarize the following text clearly."

console.log(promptDiff(text, minified));
// { before: 120, after: 92, savedPct: 23.3 }
```

---

## üß† API

```ts
promptMinify(input: string, opts?: { trim?: boolean }): string
promptDiff(input: string, output: string): { before: number; after: number; savedPct: number }
```

      `;

      const minified = promptMinify(text);
      console.log(minified);

      console.log(stats); // { before: X, after: Y, savedPct: Z }
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
