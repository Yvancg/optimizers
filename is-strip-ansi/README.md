Remove ANSI escape sequences from strings safely.  
Useful for cleaning log output or user-supplied console text before display or storage.

## üöÄ Why

Most minifiers are over-engineered, depend on heavy parsers, or risk breaking code through unsafe rewrites.
`is-minify` takes the opposite approach: it‚Äôs small, transparent, and deterministic.
	‚Ä¢	It avoids AST parsing and complex optimizations that can introduce subtle bugs.
	‚Ä¢	It guarantees that every output can still be parsed by any compliant JS or CSS engine.
	‚Ä¢	It‚Äôs ideal for quick in-browser transformations, form submissions, or server-side sanitization.
