Remove ANSI escape sequences from strings safely.  
Useful for cleaning log output or user-supplied console text before display or storage.

---

## 🚀 Why

ANSI codes are useful for terminal color and formatting, but they can:
- pollute stored logs,
- break HTML output,
- or inject misleading console artifacts.  
`is-strip-ansi` provides a minimal, dependency-free, and deterministic way to remove them.
	•	One-pass regex — fast and O(n)
	•	Works in browsers, Node, and edge runtimes
	•	Safe for untrusted input

import { stripAnsi, hasAnsi } from './is-strip-ansi/strip.js';

const noisy = '\u001B[31mError:\u001B[0m invalid token';
console.log(stripAnsi(noisy)); // → 'Error: invalid token'
console.log(hasAnsi(noisy));   // → true
```

---

## 🧠 API

```ts
stripAnsi(input: string): string
hasAnsi(input: string): boolean
safeLog(value: any): void
```
